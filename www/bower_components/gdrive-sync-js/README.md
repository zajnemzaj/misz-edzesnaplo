Add them to your app, for instance:
```    
<script src="../lib/login.service.js"></script>
<script src="../lib/drive.service.js"></script>
```

### Bower
```
  bower install gdrive-sync-js --save
```

Then import the library
```    
<script src="../bower_components/lib/login.service.js"></script>
<script src=".../bower_components/lib/drive.service.js"></script>
```

### Npm
```
  npm install gdrive-sync-js --save
```

Then import the library
```    
  <script src="../node_modules/gdrive-sync-js/lib/login.service.js"></script>
  <script src="../node_modules/gdrive-sync-js/lib/drive.service.js"></script>
```

## How to use it
After the lib is loaded you can use the new service like this

```
      var SCOPES = 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'
      var CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR CLIENT ID';
      DISCOVERY_DOCS = ['https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest'];
      window.loginService = new LoginService(CLIENT_ID, SCOPES, DISCOVERY_DOCS);
```


- SCOPES: scopes to request, as a space-delimited string. 
- CLIENT_ID: The app's client ID, found and created in the Google Developers Console.
- DISCOVERY_DOCS: are the apis that we are going to use. An array of discovery doc URLs or discovery doc JSON objects.

## File Explorer Demo (list folders and files)

![File Explorer](http://tinypic.com/r/33u721v/9)
Add your api client_id to demo/fileExplorer/index.html. You can get the client id following the instruction
from step1 here https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/js

Clone, install and run
```
npm install
npm start //to run the dev server
```

Then go to localhost:4000/demo/fileExplorer

It will ask for signin using a google account, or automatically signin if you already authorized the app. 

This demo list the folders and files from your root folder ordered by type and name. If you click in a folder it will open it and also will show in "selected resources" the folder id. If you select a file it will show you the file id.

## Old Demo (list, save, load documents)

Add your api client_id to demo/index.html. You can get the client id following the instruction
from step1 here https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/js

Clone, install and run
```
npm install
npm start //to run the dev server
```

Then go to localhost:4000/demo

The demo uses jQuery but just for hide/show stuff, is not needed.

It will ask for signin using a google account, or automatically signin if you already authorized the app. 

Write something and click save, it will create a file in your google drive called gDriveSync.example.txt.

If you change the text and save it again, it will update the file. Have in mind that if you refresh the page the doc id reference will be lost so if you save again it will create a new document. 

The document has a mimeType of application/vnd.google-apps.document' this is a google doc, so you can open and edit it from google drive.

  A file is just an object like

  var file = {id: null, name: 'testName', content:'hello' , parents:['folderId']}
  ```
  
  A resource is just an object like 
  ```
  var resource = {query_name:'file_name', parents:'folderId', mimeType:'plain/text' ,trashed:false , orderBy: 'name'}
  ```
  This is used to pass options to the list method. 
  - **trashed:** boolean value, true to show just files that are in the trash. false to not show them. not set to show everything.
  - **orderBy:** A comma-separated list of sort keys. Valid keys are 'createdTime', 'folder', 'modifiedByMeTime', 'modifiedTime', 'name', 'quotaBytesUsed', 'recency', 'sharedWithMeTime', 'starred', and 'viewedByMeTime'. Each key sorts ascending by default, but may be reversed with the 'desc' modifier.
